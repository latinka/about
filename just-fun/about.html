  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a former cabin staff at a Middle Eastern airline who enjoys <strong>travelling</strong> the world, <strong>reading</strong> great books and <strong>creating</strong> things. I currently live in Kuwait with my family.</p>
  <p>Design and creativity have always been a great part of my life. This, and the fact that I spend countless hours online, prompted my desire to delve deeper into Web Development.</p>
  <p>Continuously learning new things, be it by exploring foreign cultures or just reading a news article, is very important to me as I believe in the saying that <strong>knowledge is power</strong>.
